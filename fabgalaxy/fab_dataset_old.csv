274,2019,When is it not Craft?: Materiality and Mediation when Craft and Computing Meet,ACM TEI,"Michael Nitsche, Anna Weisling","Craft has emerged as an important reference point for HCI. To avoid a misrepresenting, all-encompassing application of craft to interaction design, this position paper first discerns craft from HCI. It develops material engagement and mediation as differentiating factors to reposition craft in relation to tangible interaction design. The aim is to clarify craft's relation to interaction design and to open up new opportunities and questions that follow from this repositioning.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3294109.3295651,https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/fabpub/img/not-craft.png,Craft; Tangible Interaction Design; Design Research; Physical Computing,,,

As a result, produced parts exhibit a so-called staircase effect, which results from sampling slanted surfaces with parallel planes. Using thinner slices reduces this effect, but it always remains visible where layers almost align with the input surfaces. In this research we exploit the ability of some additive manufacturing processes to deposit material slightly out of plane to dramatically reduce these artifacts. We focus in particular on the widespread Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) technology, since most printers in this category can deposit along slightly curved paths, under deposition slope and thickness constraints.",https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3323022,https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/fabpub/img/CurviSlicer.png,Curved Slicing; Additive Manufacturing,,,

Manufacturing such objects in a single piece is often challenging or even impossible. The alternative is to partition them into single-attribute volumetric parts that can be fabricated separately and then assembled to form the target object. Facilitating this approach requires partitioning the input model into parts that conform to the surface segmentation and that can be moved apart with no collisions. We propose Surface2Volume, a partition algorithm capable of producing such assemblable parts, each of which is affiliated with a single attribute, the outer surface of whose assembly conforms to the input surface geometry and segmentation. In computing the partition we strictly enforce conformity with surface segmentation and assemblability, and optimize for ease of fabrication by minimizing part count, promoting part simplicity, and simplifying assembly sequencing.",https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3323004,https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/fabpub/img/surface2volume.png,Shape Decomposition; Fabrication; Assemblability,,,

The augmented stitch mesh stores low-level knitting operations per-face and encodes the dependencies between faces using directed edge labels. Our system can generate knittable augmented stitch meshes from 3D models, allows users to edit these meshes in a way that preserves their knittability, and can schedule the execution order and location of each face for production on a knitting machine. Our system is general, in that its knittability-preserving editing operations are sufficient to transform between any two machine-knittable stitch patterns with the same orientation on the same surface.

We present a neural network controller design with a novel error convolution input trained by reinforcement learning. Our controller exhibits two key features: First, it does not distinguish among flying modes, and the same controller structure can be used for copters with various dynamics. Second, our controller works for real models without any additional parameter tuning process, closing the gap between virtual simulation and real fabrication.

However, existing construction materials can not be used for 3D printing as they are, and the exploration for new materials is the key to the realization of this concept. Formability and fluidity are the key factors in evaluating whether or not materials are suitable for 3D printing, including use within the field of architecture. A standardized quantitative method to evaluate construction materials is required for the comparison between materials for various projects. For example, the concrete slump test is one of the universal standards that is used to evaluate the quality and suitability for a specific construction method. In the emerging field of construction with 3D printing, however, a standardized method is yet to be established.

Thus, we contribute a unique transformation mechanism of kneaded and sheeted flour-based dough, with an integrated design strategy for morphing food during two general cooking methods: dehydration (e.g. baking) or hydration (e.g. water boiling). We also enrich the design space of morphing food by demonstrating several applications. We end by discussing hybrid cooking between human and a design tool that we developed to ensure accuracy while preserving customizability for morphing food.",https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3347949,https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/fabpub/img/Morphlour.png,Morphing Food; Programmable Material; Interactive Food; Design Tool; Dehydration; Hydration; Hybrid Cooking,,,

Our work explores the design space of Skin-On interfaces by following a bio-driven approach: (1) From a sensory point of view, we study how to reproduce the look and feel of the human skin through three user studies; (2) From a gestural point of view, we explore how gestures naturally performed on skin can be transposed to Skin-On interfaces; (3) From a technical point of view, we explore and discuss different ways of fabricating interfaces that mimic human skin sensitivity and can recognize the gestures observed in the previous study; (4) We assemble the insights of our three exploratory facets to implement a series of Skin-On interfaces and we also contribute by providing a toolkit that enables easy reproduction and fabrication.",https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3347943,https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/fabpub/img/phoneskin.png,Skin-on; Artificial Skin; Malleable; Deformable; Sensing; Interaction Techniques,,,

In order to impart this self-healing property to our daily life interface, we propose Self-healing UI, a soft-bodied interface that can intrinsically self-heal damages without external stimuli or glue. The key material to achieving Self-healing UI is MWCNTs-PBS, a composite material of a self-healing polymer polyborosiloxane (PBS) and a filler material multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), which retains mechanical and electrical self-healability. We developed a hybrid model that combines PBS, MWCNTs-PBS, and other common soft materials including fabric and silicone to build interface devices with self-healing, sensing, and actuation capability. These devices were implemented by layer-by-layer stacking fabrication without glue or any post-processing, by leveraging the materials' inherent self-healing property between two layers. We then demonstrated sensing primitives and interactive applications that extend the design space of shape-changing interfaces with their ability to transform, conform, reconfigure, heal, and fuse, which we believe can enrich the toolbox of human-computer interaction (HCI).",https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3347901,https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/fabpub/img/selfhealing.png,Self-Healing Materials; Material-Driven Interfaces; Shape-Changing Interfaces; Sensing and Actuation System; Bio-Inspired Interfaces; Radical Atoms; Soft Matters,,,

Our approach makes it easier for casual users to customize machine-knitted garments, while enabling more advanced users to design their own composable templates. Our tool combines ideas from CAD software and image editing: it allows the composition of (1) parametric knitted primitives, and (2) stitch pattern layers with different resampling behaviours. By leveraging the regularity of our primitives, our tool enables interactive customization with automated layout and real-time patterning feedback. We show a variety of garments and patterns created with our tool, and highlight our ability to transfer shape and pattern customizations between users.",https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3347879,https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/fabpub/img/Alexandrekaspar.png,Computerized Knitting; CAD; Shaping; Patterning,,,

By controlling the movement of the print header, the FDM alternately weaves the stringing fibers across a row of pillars. Owing to the structure of the fibers, which supports and strengthens the pillars from each side, a 3D printer can print a thin sheet of fabric in an upright position while the fibers are being woven. In addition, this technique enables users to employ materials with various colors and/or properties when designing a pattern, and to prototype an interactive object using a variety of off-the-shelf materials such as a conductive filament. We also describe a technique for weaving textiles and introduce a list of parameters that enable users to design their own textile variations.",https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3347896,https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/fabpub/img/3d-printed-textiles.png,Digital Fabrication; 3D Printing; Fused Deposition Modeling; 3D Printed Textile; Printing Technique,,,

Our technique recognizes conductive objects (mainly metallic) that are commonly found in households and workplaces, such as keys, coins, and electronic devices. We built a prototype containing six by six spiral-shaped coils made of conductive thread, sewn onto a four-layer fabric structure. We carefully designed the coil shape parameters to maximize the sensitivity based on a new inductance approximation formula. Through a ten-participant study, we evaluated the performance of our proposed sensing technique across 27 common objects.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3332165.3347897,https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/fabpub/img/Tessutivo.png,Inductive Sensing; Interactive Fabrics; Object Recognition,,,

We introduce SensorSnaps, low-power wireless sensor nodes that seamlessly integrate into caps of fabric snap fasteners. SensorSnaps provide a new technique to quickly and intuitively augment any location on the clothing with sensing capabilities. SensorSnaps securely attach and detach from ubiquitous commercial snap fasteners. Using inertial measurement units, the SensorSnaps detect tap and rotation gestures, as well as track body motion. We optimized the power consumption for SensorSnaps to work continuously for 45 minutes and up to 4 hours in capacitive touch standby mode. We present applications in which the SensorSnaps are used as gestural interfaces for a music player controller, cursor control, and motion tracking suit. The user study showed that SensorSnap could be attached in around 71 seconds, similar to attaching off-the-shelf snaps, and participants found the gestures easy to learn and perform. SensorSnaps could allow anyone to effortlessly add sophisticated sensing capacities to ubiquitous snap fasteners.",https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3347913,https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/fabpub/img/SensorSnaps.png,Wireless Sensor Nodes; Wearables; Textile Interfaces; Ubiquitous Computing; Low-Power,,,

However, little work addresses the challenges of designing and using knitted textures computationally. We present KnitPick: a pipeline for interpreting hand-knitting texture patterns into KnitGraphs which can be output to machine and hand-knitting instructions. Using KnitPick, we contribute a measured and photographed data set of 302 knitted textures. Based on findings from this data set, we contribute two algorithms for manipulating KnitGraphs. KnitCarving shapes a graph while respecting a texture, and KnitPatching combines graphs with disparate textures while maintaining a consistent shape.

The key idea builds on the use of photochromic inks that can switch their appearance from transparent to colored when exposed to light of a certain wavelength. By mixing cyan, magenta, and yellow (CMY) photochromic dyes into a single solution and leveraging the different absorption spectra of each dye, we can control each color channel in the solution separately. Our approach can transform single-material fabrication techniques, such as coating, into high-resolution multi-color processes. We discuss the material mixing procedure, modifications to the light source, and the algorithm to control each color channel. We then show the results from an experiment in which we evaluated the available color space and the resolution of our textures. Finally, we demonstrate our user interface that allows users to transfer virtual textures onto physical objects and show a range of application examples.",https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3347905,https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/fabpub/img/Photo-Chromeleon.png,Personal Fabrication; Programmable Matter; Multi-Color Textures; Color Change; Photochromic,,,
